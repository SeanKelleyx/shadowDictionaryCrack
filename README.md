shadowDictionaryCrack
=====================

A python app to run dictionary crack against passwords in /etc/shadow
-------------------
future add-ins
-------------------
  -I will be adding an example passwords.txt file to mimic the /etc/shadow file with users who have used passowrds in a      dictionary.
  -I will be adding a sample dictionary.txt file, nothing complete just enough to be effective to the example                passwords.txt file
